# **Digital policy in the age of LLMs**

## **Automation of the service sector, cloud infrastructure, and the reshaping of economic sovereignty**

### Introduction

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) marks a major turning point in the recent history of digital technology. More than just a one-off technical advance, it introduces a change in the economic system based on a massive reduction in cognitive costs: writing code, integrating complex systems, exploiting digital infrastructure, and automating tertiary processes is becoming faster, less expensive, and accessible to a wider range of players. This evolution simultaneously affects productivity, skilled employment, the organization of digital sectors, and the concrete conditions for economic autonomy.

For France, whose economy relies heavily on high value-added tertiary industries, this transformation is both a source of vulnerability and a strategic opportunity. Sectors that have historically been key drivers of the economy—banking, insurance, consulting, IT services, and compliance functions—are seeing a growing proportion of their activities become automatable. At the same time, LLMs are once again making it possible to pursue a digital policy geared toward industrialization, integration, and control of critical uses, without requiring the replication of the hyperscale model promoted by the major global platforms.

Digital autonomy is no longer solely a matter of model design, but also of the ability to operate robust, secure, reversible clouds that are adapted to regulated sectors, without structural dependence on non-European infrastructure.
Moreover, these dynamics extend far beyond the European framework. The trajectories observable in Africa, where LLMs facilitate leapfrogging strategies and the possible emergence of regional clouds, illustrate the global scope of these transformations. They are helping to redefine the balance of influence based on the export of tertiary services and are calling into question the future modalities of economic and digital cooperation.

This report offers a structured analysis of these changes. It examines the redefinition of the conditions for a digital policy, the impact of LLMs on the tertiary sector, the central role of the cloud in digital autonomy, the associated geo-economic implications, and the instruments that can be used to transform these findings into an operational trajectory. The aim is not to formulate a political program, but to provide an economic analysis framework for understanding the systemic effects of generative AI on productivity, infrastructure, and digital autonomy.

## PART I — Accessibility: why a digital policy is once again possible for France

### I.1. Technological regime change: partial democratization of power

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) marks a technological regime change comparable, in terms of its economic effects, to the computerization of the 1980s or the spread of the Internet in the 2000s. The novelty lies not only in the performance of the models, but also in the **drastic reduction in the cognitive cost of development**. A growing proportion of tasks traditionally reserved for engineers or experts—code writing, testing, documentation, support, infrastructure configuration—are becoming automatable or semi-automatable.

This dynamic has three major macroeconomic effects. First, it **accelerates R&D cycles**, significantly reducing the time between the idea and the functional product. Second, it **compresses product cycles**, with more frequent iterations and lower entry costs. Finally, there is a **lowering of the threshold for accessing advanced capabilities**, allowing medium-sized players to develop complex services that were previously reserved for large platforms.

However, this democratization remains **partial**. Access to a model, whether open source or provided via API, is not the same as the ability to turn it into a productive asset.
 The competitive advantage is shifting towards **industrialization capacity**: data quality and governance, computing and storage infrastructure, software chain security, integration into real business processes, and large-scale operation. In other words, power is not disappearing; it is changing medium.

### I.2. Digital sovereignty: from ideology to economic calculation

In this new context, digital sovereignty ceases to be a slogan or a defensive posture and becomes a **question of economic calculation**. So-called “effective” sovereignty is no longer defined by technological self-sufficiency, but by **control over critical uses**: government information systems, health data, financial infrastructure, and strategic industrial chains. It is also measured by **resilience** in the face of technological, geopolitical, or regulatory disruptions.

The central issue then becomes the **total cost of dependency**. This aggregates dimensions that have long been underestimated: dependence on data and its hosting, compliance costs imposed by extraterritorial standards, technological lock-in linked to platforms, and legal and strategic exposure to foreign decisions. In many cases, these deferred costs exceed the immediate productivity gains offered by dominant solutions.

Understood in this way, digital sovereignty does not aim to exclude foreign technologies, but to **rationally arbitrate** between short-term gains and long-term structural dependencies. By lowering development and integration costs, LLMs are making this arbitration economically credible for national and European players for the first time.

### I.3. France: structural strengths and blind spots

France has significant assets to transform this technological window into a coherent public policy. It retains a **diversified industrial base**, a **large public sector** capable of playing a structuring role as a customer, a recognized regulatory framework, and **European telecom and cloud players** with real infrastructure. Added to this is a historically strong ecosystem of expertise in mathematics, engineering, and cybersecurity.

However, these strengths coexist with **persistent blind spots**. The first is the absence of hyperscale players capable of competing head-on with the major American platforms in terms of volume and unit cost of computing. The second is a **critical dependence** on GPU supply chains and extra-European cloud services for large-scale model training and operation. Finally, French and European offerings remain **fragmented**, both industrially and commercially, which complicates the emergence of integrated solutions that are internationally recognized.

It is precisely in the tension between these strengths and limitations that the challenge of digital policy lies: not to replicate the hyperscaler model, but to build an industrialization capacity that is adapted to critical uses, economically sustainable, and strategically controlled.


## **PART II — The French service sector and LLM: productivity, employment, income, and repositioning**

### **II.1. The service sector as a “historical driver”: what is being called into question**

For several decades, the French economy has relied heavily on a **high value-added service sector**, structured around sectors such as banking and insurance, consulting, auditing, legal services, and IT services.
 The economic value of these activities did not come primarily from physical capital, but from **procedural expertise** (mastery of rules, standards, and methods) and **cognitive intermediation**: analyzing, interpreting, qualifying, and deciding on behalf of others.

This model enabled France to partially offset the erosion of its industrial base by exporting services, regulatory know-how, and organized complexity. However, it is precisely this foundation—the ability to transform complexity into income—that LLMs are undermining. By automating a growing share of standardized cognitive tasks, they are reducing the scarcity that historically justified the value of these intermediaries.

The challenge is therefore not marginal: it affects the **economic heart of the French service sector**, where margins, skilled jobs, and international influence were concentrated.

### **II.2. What is really being automated... and what is resisting**

Contrary to a caricatured view, LLMs do not automate the “service sector” as a whole, but operate a **clear segmentation** between industrializable tasks and functions with a strong strategic or relational dimension.

The following are already largely automatable, or in the process of becoming so: administrative and financial back office, first-level customer support, level 1 regulatory compliance (KYC, standard controls), recurring reporting, routine application maintenance, and a significant portion of standard software development. In these areas, human added value is rapidly declining, and competition is mainly based on costs and integration.

Conversely, certain functions are structurally resistant to automation. These include arbitration in ambiguous situations, complex or sensitive customer relations, governance and strategic decision-making, product or system design, negotiation, and the management of rare or systemic risks. These activities require judgment, responsibility, and a deep contextual understanding that LLMs can only assist with, but cannot replace.

The challenge for the French service sector is therefore not to reject automation, but to **reposition itself in these areas of resistance**, where value remains sustainable.

### **II.3. Macroeconomic effects: productivity shock and structural shock**

On a macroeconomic scale, the emergence of LLMs is producing a **double shock**. On the one hand, there is a productivity shock: industrializable services are seeing their unit costs fall, which improves overall efficiency. On the other hand, there is a structural shock: **margins for standardized tertiary activities are shrinking sharply**, putting pressure on entire economic models.

This dynamic gives rise to a major risk: the **disintermediation** of French players in favor of large platforms capable of industrializing these automated services on a global scale. In this scenario, France would consume high-productivity services without capturing their value, replicating in the tertiary sector the dependence observed in other sectors.

But this transformation also opens up a strategic opportunity. The decline in cognitive costs allows for the **re-internalization** of previously outsourced functions, particularly within industry and medium-sized companies. It also promotes an **upgrade** of the service sector towards activities such as architecture, high-level expertise, cybersecurity, and the governance of complex systems.

### **II.4. Public policy: cushioning the shock, capturing the gains**

In the face of this reconfiguration, public policy has a decisive role to play in preventing the shock from resulting solely in job losses and a decline in national value. The first lever is **retraining**: massively developing skills related to AI integration, cybersecurity, data governance, and cloud operations, where structural demand is set to grow.

The second lever lies in **economic instruments**. Public procurement can play an anchor customer role in steering the market towards sovereign and integrated solutions. Targeted loans can support the transformation of existing tertiary players. Standardization—in terms of security, reversibility, and auditability of systems—makes it possible to structure a market that is favorable to national players. Finally, the protection and control of critical sectors (finance, health, government, energy) are an essential foundation for sustainably capturing the productivity gains generated by LLM.

Thus, far from heralding the end of the tertiary sector, LLMs are imposing a **profound transformation**: from a tertiary sector based on procedural complexity to one based on the design, governance, and control of automated systems.

## PART III — Cloud: the new center of gravity for digital autonomy

### (LLMs → integration + development → independence)

### III.1. The development of complex cloud solutions as a sovereignty infrastructure is becoming accessible

For more than a decade, the cloud was seen as a domain reserved for a few players capable of absorbing extremely high development, operating, and integration costs. Technical complexity—orchestration, security, observability, automation, support—was a major barrier to entry. The arrival of LLMs is profoundly changing this balance.

By automating a significant portion of **software development**, infrastructure configuration, incident management, and documentation, LLMs lower the cognitive and organizational cost of building complex cloud solutions. It is now possible for a much larger number of digital players to design and operate functional, secure cloud platforms that are suitable for professional use.

This democratization does not mean the disappearance of power gaps, but rather an **expansion of the field of players capable of operating sovereign infrastructures**. The cloud is gradually ceasing to be an industrial monopoly and becoming a modular, reproducible, and integrable infrastructure, provided that the overall engineering can be mastered. As such, it is establishing itself as an **infrastructure of sovereignty**, on a par with energy and telecommunications.

### III.2. French digital policy as a factor in development

In this new context, France's digital policy can once again become a **lever for economic development**, rather than simply a regulatory framework. The lower integration costs brought about by LLM make it feasible to pursue a strategy aimed at structuring a national and European cloud ecosystem geared towards critical uses and the real needs of government agencies and businesses.

Rather than seeking to compete head-on with hyperscalers on a global scale, France has an opportunity to promote **specialized cloud solutions** that are integrated with regulatory, sectoral, and territorial constraints. Public policy can play a catalytic role by guiding demand, stabilizing standards, and reducing risk for industrial players.

Designed in this way, digital policy is no longer limited to protection, but becomes a **tool for industrialization**: it promotes the emergence of local value chains, supports investment in infrastructure, and accelerates the spread of cloud solutions adapted to regulated sectors.

### III.3. France: a strategic window of opportunity for OVHcloud, Orange, and industrial alliances

In this context, France has a strategic window of opportunity for players such as OVHcloud and Orange, as well as for industrial alliances bringing together telecoms, cloud providers, integrators, and cybersecurity players. Their natural positioning is based on a **local cloud** model, designed to meet the requirements of regulated sectors and critical infrastructure.

This model combines several key dimensions: hybridization between on-premises and cloud systems, ensuring operational continuity; regulatory compliance and legal sovereignty of data; reversibility of architectures to limit lock-in situations; and a high level of security built in from the design stage. The integration of telecom networks, cloud capabilities, and AI building blocks is a major differentiating factor that is difficult for pure platform players to replicate.

In this configuration, value does not lie in the absolute size of the cloud, but in its **integration capacity**, its proximity to users, and its mastery of critical constraints.

### III.4. Structural limitations: GPUs, supply chains, and standards

Despite these opportunities, certain limitations remain structural. Dependence on advanced semiconductors, particularly GPUs, is a major point of fragility, as is the energy dependence associated with intensive computing infrastructures. These constraints serve as a reminder that digital autonomy cannot be considered independently of industrial and energy policies.

Furthermore, technical and software standards—often defined at the international level—have a strong influence on the interoperability and competitiveness of cloud solutions. The challenge is not to ignore these factors, but to **influence their definition** and ensure that national solutions are compatible with global ecosystems.

Faced with these limitations, complementary strategies are needed: European pooling of computing capacities, targeted industrial partnerships, and sovereign procurement policies to secure critical supplies. These levers determine the ability to transform the window of opportunity opened by LLMs into sustainable autonomy rather than misplaced dependence.

## PART IV — Africa: tertiary autonomy and regional cloud (effects on French/European influence)
### IV.1. LLMs and “leapfrogging”: cognitive autonomy and financial services

The arrival of large language models is profoundly changing the digital development trajectories of African countries. Where the gap with European economies was historically measured in terms of specialized human capital and access to expertise, LLMs are introducing a dynamic of cognitive leapfrogging: they make it possible to skip certain stages of tertiary sector maturation by rapidly internalizing highly procedural functions.

In the banking sector, the effects are particularly transformative. Key functions—KYC/AML, credit scoring, first-level customer support, operational back office, standard regulatory reporting—are becoming automatable or semi-automatable at low marginal cost. This development makes it possible to internalize skills that were previously outsourced to European firms or infrastructures, often due to regulatory complexity or a lack of local resources.

The result is a gradual reduction in dependence on European expertise, not through political rejection, but through economic rationality. African banks can develop systems that are better suited to local realities (alternative data, mobile uses, informal contexts) while improving their operational efficiency. Tertiary autonomy is thus ceasing to be a distant goal and becoming a credible medium-term option.

### **IV.2. African cloud: no need for hyperscale to be sovereign**

This cognitive autonomy finds a natural extension in the question of the cloud. Unlike the dominant model promoted by hyperscalers, African digital sovereignty does not require a massive continent-wide computing infrastructure. A **realistic strategy** is based on the creation of regional clouds, backed by critical sectors (finance, telecoms, public services), supported by sovereign data centers and interconnected at the regional level.

LLMs play an accelerating role here: they reduce the costs of operating, maintaining, and integrating cloud infrastructures, enabling smaller teams to operate complex systems. The value lies not in the absolute size of the cloud, but in its **ability to meet local needs**, guarantee data availability, and offer a sufficient level of security and resilience.

There are many players likely to support this model: telecom operators that already have networks and points of presence, banks seeking to secure their critical systems, governments concerned about the sovereignty of public data, and consortia bringing together public and private players. This plurality favors hybrid architectures, which are less dependent on a single player and more resilient to external shocks.

### **IV.3. Geo-economic implications for France and Europe**

For France and, more broadly, for Europe, these developments are leading to a **gradual erosion of tertiary soft power**. The influence historically exerted by consulting, regulatory compliance, financial engineering, and IT services is tending to diminish as these functions become automated and localized. The risk is that of a silent loss of position, without any visible disruption but simply through technological substitution.

However, this transformation also opens up a major strategic opportunity. Rather than seeking to preserve a declining service income, France can reposition itself as an **infrastructure partner**. This involves prioritizing cooperation based on the deployment of regional clouds, network interconnection, local skills training, and the strengthening of cybersecurity.

In this model, influence no longer relies on the export of complexity or standards, but on the **co-construction of sustainable digital infrastructures**. Such an approach would enable France and Europe to maintain a strategic presence in Africa, no longer as dominant providers of tertiary services, but as key players in an autonomous and interoperable digital ecosystem.

## **PART V — France's roadmap: doctrine, instruments, and implementation priorities**

### **V.1. Defining a national doctrine of “productive digital”**

The first requirement for a credible French strategy in the era of LLM is the adoption of a **clear doctrine of productive digital technology**. The challenge is not innovation for its own sake, nor the symbolic race for model performance, but the **effective transformation of AI into measurable productivity gains** in industry and critical services.

This doctrine is based on a central principle: **pragmatic sovereignty**. This does not mean technological self-sufficiency or rejection of global ecosystems, but rather **control over critical dependencies**. The key question becomes: in which areas is dependence acceptable, and in which does it constitute an economic, legal, or strategic risk? LLMs make this approach possible by reducing the cost of entry for national or European solutions, where arbitration was previously unfavorable.

### **V.2. Three operational pillars for implementation**

The doctrine must be translated into action structured around three operational pillars.

The first pillar concerns the **sovereignty of critical workloads**. The information systems of the state, health, finance, defense, and energy must be subject to an explicit policy of localization, control, and audit. The objective is not national exclusivity, but rather the guarantee that vital functions remain operational, audited, and legally controlled in all circumstances.

The second pillar concerns the **industrialization of the local cloud**. France cannot and must not seek to replicate the hyperscaler model. However, it can structure a hybrid, reversible, and certified cloud capable of serving the needs of government agencies, critical infrastructure, and regulated companies. LLM can reduce operating costs and improve service quality, making this model economically sustainable.

The third pillar is **skills and tools**. Value will no longer lie in simply owning the models, but in the ability to integrate, operate them, and secure them. This implies a massive investment in the fields of AIOps, SecOps, AI governance, data lineage, and complex systems architecture.

### **V.3. Economic policy instruments**

The implementation of this roadmap requires appropriate economic instruments. The first is **public procurement**, used as an “anchor customer” to structure a national and European market. By directing demand towards solutions that comply with sovereignty requirements, the state can reduce the risk for private actors and accelerate industrialization.

The second instrument is **standardization**. Clear standards for reversibility, auditability, AI system security, and data governance create a competitive advantage for actors able to comply with them, while limiting the effects of technological lock-in.

Added to this is **targeted capital support**: investments in data centers and associated energy, incentives for data localization and computing capacity, and support for shared infrastructure. Finally,
 
**regulatory sandboxes**, particularly in the financial sector, can enable advanced uses of AI to be tested under supervision, without stifling innovation through excessive ex ante caution.

### **V.4. Steering indicators: measuring to govern**

A productive digital policy cannot be steered without clear indicators. Several **think tank-level KPIs** can be used to assess the actual trajectory.

The first is the **share of critical workloads hosted in France or the European Union**, a direct indicator of operational control. The second is the **rate of reversibility and portability of cloud environments**, measured objectively by migration and audit tests.

Added to this are **tertiary productivity** indicators, such as the average cost per file processed, per claim, or per regulatory control, which make it possible to objectively measure the gains associated with automation. The **rate of AI adoption in mid-sized companies and industry** is another key indicator of the actual spread of the technology.

Finally, **dependence on GPUs and the share of local or European computing** must be monitored as long-term strategic indicators, in the same way as energy or certain critical raw materials. Measuring these dependencies means giving ourselves the means to arbitrate them, rather than suffer them.

## General conclusion

The analysis developed in this report highlights a profound and lasting transformation of the digital landscape. Large language models are not a marginal innovation, but a factor in the structural reorganization of the economy, particularly in countries with a high level of tertiarization such as France. By lowering the cognitive cost of developing, integrating, and operating complex systems, they are shifting the dividing lines between dominant and dependent players.

This dynamic directly affects the service sector, which has long been based on the scarcity of procedural expertise and the intermediation of complexity. The partial automation of these functions is leading to a compression of existing rents and a recomposition of value chains. It does not mean the disappearance of the service sector, but its transformation: value is shifting towards the functions of design, architecture, governance, and control of automated systems.

In this context, the cloud appears to be the new center of gravity for digital autonomy. As LLMs become industrial building blocks, the location and control of workloads, data, and integration capabilities are becoming decisive factors. Lower engineering costs now make local, hybrid, and specialized cloud models accessible without the need to reach hyperscale. Autonomy is no longer defined by the absolute size of infrastructures, but by their suitability for critical uses and their controlled operating capacity.

The African example sheds light on these developments from a complementary angle. The leapfrogging strategies made possible by LLMs show that tertiary autonomy and the emergence of regional clouds can occur without replicating the cumbersome trajectories of advanced economies. This development automatically changes the balance of influence based on the export of tertiary services and regulatory complexity, and calls for a rethinking of forms of economic cooperation.

Finally, the roadmap outlined for France emphasizes that the central issue is not the adoption of AI as such, but its translation into real productivity, resilience, and capacity for action. The combination of an explicit doctrine, clear operational priorities, and steering indicators makes it possible to approach this transformation as a governable process, rather than an imposed evolution.

Ultimately, LLMs do not eliminate dependencies or asymmetries, but rather reconfigure them. They shift the value from intermediation functions to infrastructure and usage control, and redefine the conditions under which an economy can maintain its autonomy in a digital environment that has become more accessible, but also more competitive.
