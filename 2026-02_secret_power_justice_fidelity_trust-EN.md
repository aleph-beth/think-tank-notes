# Loyalty or trust: two architectures of intelligence

## Introduction

Intelligence is often presented as a technical function: gathering information, anticipating threats, protecting national security. This presentation masks the essential. Behind the methods, technologies, and clandestine operations, intelligence is first and foremost a **moral institution**, embodying a certain conception of order, authority, and justice.

The hypothesis of this work is simple but fundamental: **there are two main types of secret services**, defined not by their means, but by the core value that organizes them. These two models are based on opposing moral architectures: **loyalty** and **trust**.

Services based on loyalty demand allegiance. They require agents to be loyal to a power, a state, a regime, or a leader. In this context, loyalty becomes an end in itself; justice is subordinated to efficiency and truth to strategic utility. This model produces powerful, coherent, and formidably effective apparatuses in the short term, but ones that are structurally prone to drift, opacity, and rupture with the social body.

In contrast, services based on trust are founded on a different logic. Authority is conditional, legitimacy depends on actions, and action is limited by a requirement for justice. Trust is never taken for granted: it is built, verified, and can be lost. In this model, the agent is not primarily loyal to a power, but accountable to a higher standard—the law, justice, or a transcendent ethic. These services are often less visible, less celebrated, and more fragile in the face of forceful logic, but they are pillars of lasting stability.

This opposition does not refer to an abstract distinction between good and evil. It runs through the history of states, empires, religious traditions, and modern institutions. It sheds light on the internal tensions of contemporary intelligence: between effectiveness and legitimacy, secrecy and truth, obedience and conscience.

By contrasting loyalty and trust, this work does not seek to idealize one model over the other, but to show that **each secret service embodies a fundamental political and moral choice** . This choice determines not only how they operate in the shadows, but also the type of order their actions help to maintain—an order based on fear and allegiance, or an order based on justice and accountability.

## PART I — The world of loyalty-based services

### I.1 — Founding principle: allegiance

Loyalty-based secret services are founded on a simple and powerful principle: **allegiance takes precedence over everything else**. Agents are not primarily accountable to an abstract standard—justice, law, or morality—but to a concrete entity: the state, the regime, the leader, or the apparatus itself.

In this model, loyalty is not just a virtue; it becomes a **condition of existence**. Being loyal means being aligned, available, and silent. The central question is not “Is the action right?” but “Does it serve the power I defend?”

This logic produces strong internal cohesion, but it implies a structural subordination of moral judgment to strategic interest. Loyalty becomes an end in itself, regardless of the nature of what it protects.

---

### I.2 — Internal organization: verticality and discipline

Services based on loyalty are characterized by a **strict vertical organization**. The hierarchy is not only functional, but symbolic. It embodies the order to be preserved.

The recurring features of this organization are:

* extensive compartmentalization of information,
* downward circulation of orders,
* low tolerance for internal dissent,
* promotion based on loyalty rather than rectitude.

Secrecy is not only an operational necessity; it becomes a **tool for internal control**. To know is to depend. To challenge is to betray.

---

### I.3 — Relationship to truth: an instrumental resource

In this model, truth has no intrinsic value. It is a **strategic resource** that can be manipulated, selected, and sometimes sacrificed.

Information is:

* filtered according to its usefulness,
* presented in a biased manner,
* sometimes distorted to produce a political effect.

Lying is not a moral accident, but a **standardized tool**. It is judged not on its conformity to reality, but on its effectiveness.

This logic ultimately produces an internal effect: when truth is instrumentalized externally, it is also instrumentalized internally. Decision-makers themselves become captive to the narratives they are fed.

---

### I.4 — Relationship to justice: raison d'état as the ultimate limit

In services based on loyalty, justice is subordinate to raison d'état. The law can be circumvented, suspended, or redefined in the name of security, urgency, or the greater good.

Action is deemed legitimate as long as it protects the existing order. The moral question is shifted: it is no longer “is it fair?” but “is it necessary?”

This shift is decisive. It gradually transforms the exception into the norm and establishes a morality of efficiency, where success retrospectively validates the means employed.

---

### I.5 — Structural strengths and weaknesses

Services based on loyalty have **undeniable strengths**:

* high short-term effectiveness,
* high coercive power,
* strong internal discipline,
* responsiveness in crisis situations.

But these strengths also carry with them weaknesses:

* authoritarian abuses,
* internal corruption,
* loss of social legitimacy,
* geopolitical boomerang effects,
* gradual empowerment of the apparatus relative to politics.

In the long term, these services tend to defend their own survival as much—if not more—than the order they were supposed to protect.

---

### I.6 — Interim summary

Secret services based on loyalty are **machines of power**. They excel at preserving the existing order, but at the cost of a gradual erosion of justice and trust.

They produce apparent stability, often at the expense of real legitimacy. When loyalty becomes absolute, it ceases to protect power: it locks it into a defensive, opaque, and self-referential logic.

---

## PART II — The world of services based on trust

### II.1 — Founding principle: moral responsibility

Trust-based services are based on a principle that is the opposite of allegiance: **authority is conditional and moral responsibility comes first**. The agent is not bound by unconditional loyalty to a power, but by a requirement for justice that limits and frames action.

In this model, obedience is never absolute. It is subordinate to the legitimacy of the order received. The structuring question becomes: “Is this action fair, proportionate, and necessary?” Trust cannot be decreed; it must be earned and maintained through consistency between actions and proclaimed standards.

---

II.2 — Internal organization: functional hierarchy and responsibility

The organization of services based on trust remains structured, but according to a functional hierarchy that is not sacrosanct. Authority is linked to competence, mission, and responsibility, rather than to personal or clan loyalty.

Recurring characteristics include:

* explicit rules governing clandestine action,
* internal control and appeal mechanisms,
* institutional protection of individual conscience,
* the formal possibility of reporting or refusing an unjust order.

Secrecy remains necessary, but it is strictly **operational**. It is not used to discipline agents or neutralize internal criticism.

---

### II.3 — Relationship to the truth: obligation and responsibility

In this model, the truth is not a strategic adjustment variable, but a **differentiated moral obligation**. While secrecy is legitimate vis-à-vis the outside world, internal lying is considered destructive.

The information transmitted to decision-makers must be:

* complete,
* contextualized,
* true to reality,
* clearly distinguished from hypotheses or influence operations.

This requirement aims to avoid a classic pitfall of clandestine agencies: the production of narratives that end up deceiving the very people they claim to serve.

---

### II.4 — Relationship with justice: the uncrossable line

Services based on trust recognize a **non-negotiable moral boundary**. Certain actions, even if effective, are excluded because they undermine justice, the law, or human dignity.

In this context:

* the end does not justify the means,
* urgency does not indefinitely suspend the norm,
* security does not automatically take precedence over the law.

Disobedience can become a duty when the order received violates these principles. This possibility is not seen as a threat, but as an **ultimate guarantee of legitimacy**.

---

### II.5 — Structural strengths and weaknesses

Trust-based services have **specific strengths**:

* lasting legitimacy,
* increased credibility among the population,
* greater long-term resilience,
* agents who are difficult to corrupt or manipulate.

But these strengths come at a cost:

* sometimes reduced immediate effectiveness,
* vulnerability to cynical adversaries,
* recurring tensions with political authorities,
* increased exposure in the context of asymmetric warfare.

These services accept a degree of fragility as the price of their moral consistency.

---

### II.6 — Interim summary

Secret services based on trust are **institutions of restraint**. They do not accumulate the maximum possible power, but seek to preserve the legitimacy of the order they defend.

They produce less visible domination, but more real stability. Their apparent fragility is the flip side of a more discreet strength: the ability to act without compromising their principles, and to endure without becoming an autonomous apparatus cut off from all justice.

---

## PART III — Systemic comparison: two rationales for secrecy

### III.1 — Two incompatible rationalities

The two models studied are not simply organizational variations. They reflect **profoundly incompatible rationalities of secrecy**. Whereas services based on loyalty are part of a logic of cumulative power, those based on trust are part of a logic of voluntary limitation.

In the first case, secrecy is conceived as a force multiplier; in the second, as a space for restraint. This difference explains why attempts at hybridization often fail: introducing trust into a loyalty-based system is perceived as a weakness, while introducing unconditional loyalty into a trust-based system is seen as moral corruption.

---

### III.2 — Summary comparison table

| Area of analysis | Loyalty services | Trust services |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Core value | Loyalty | Justice |
| Purpose | Accumulation of power | Preservation of justice |
| Relationship to authority | Vertical, unconditional | Conditional, responsible |
| Relationship to truth | Instrumental | Internally mandatory |
| Relationship to law | Subordinate | Insurmountable limit |
| Internal criticism | Betrayal | Necessity |
| Temporality | Short/medium term | Long term |

This table does not describe abstract ideals, but structural trends observable in the history of clandestine institutions.

---

### III.3 — Dynamics of change

No real service exists in its pure form. Systems based on trust can shift towards loyalty under the influence of recurring factors:

* prolonged war,
* feeling of encirclement or existential threat,
* excessive concentration of executive power,
* disappearance of effective countervailing powers,
* sacralization of the security apparatus.

Conversely, a return to a trust-based model is historically rare. It requires a major crisis of legitimacy, followed by a moral and institutional overhaul. This process is long, fragile, and politically costly.

---

### III.4 — Effects on agents

The two models produce very different human profiles.

Services based on loyalty favor agents who are:

* obedient,
* resilient,
* reluctant to question,
* capable of carrying out ambiguous orders without moral dissonance.

Services based on trust, on the contrary, select agents who are:

* with a strong sense of responsibility,
* capable of independent judgment,
* resistant to corruption,
* able to withstand moral isolation.

These profiles are rarely interchangeable. An agent trained in one model often experiences profound dissonance when transferred to the other.

---

### III.5 — Effects on society and politics

Services based on loyalty tend to produce, in the long term, a **society of mistrust**. Secrecy spreads beyond its initial perimeter, contaminating the political, media, and institutional spheres. Fear becomes an implicit mode of government.

Conversely, trust-based services contribute to **discreet stability**. Their invisibility is not based on fear, but on social acceptance of their legitimacy. Secrecy remains confined to its function.

In both cases, intelligence shapes the political order it claims only to serve.

---

### III.6 — Summary of the comparison

The difference between loyalty and trust is not moral in the simplistic sense; it is **structural and civilizational**. Each model corresponds to a certain conception of man, authority, and time.

Services based on loyalty protect above all the continuity of power. Services based on trust seek to preserve the continuity of justice.

This choice is never neutral. It determines not only how to act in the shadows, but also the form of the political order that is to endure.

---

## General conclusion — The choice of secrecy is a choice of civilization

This work has shown that intelligence is never a simple technique. It is a **form of invisible government**, which reveals the real hierarchy of values in a society. Behind clandestine methods lies a more fundamental choice: **to serve power through loyalty, or to serve justice through trust**.

Services based on loyalty prioritize cohesion, immediate effectiveness, and the continuity of the existing order. They protect power, sometimes successfully, often at the cost of a gradual erosion of legitimacy. As loyalty becomes unconditional, secrecy ceases to be a tool and becomes an end in itself; the apparatus protects itself, and reasons of state tend to replace all other norms.

Conversely, services based on trust accept restraint, fragility, and moral responsibility. They renounce a share of domination in order to preserve what is right. Their effectiveness is not always spectacular, but their stability is more profound: it is based on consistency between actions, law, and ethics. Where loyalty demands obedience, trust demands justice.

This opposition is neither abstract nor moral in a simplistic sense. It runs through the history of institutions, religions, empires, and modern states. It explains the recurring cycles of security drift, loss of legitimacy, and difficult rebuilding. Above all, it sheds light on an often-hidden truth: **secrecy shapes the political order as much as it protects it**.

At a time when intelligence is becoming algorithmic, predictive, and systemic, this choice is becoming increasingly serious. Loyalty can now be automated, rated, and monitored. Trust, on the other hand, cannot be coded: it presupposes human limits, personal responsibility, and a standard that transcends calculation. The more secret becomes technologized, the more decisive the question of its moral foundation becomes.

Ultimately, no society can do without shadows. But every society must decide what those shadows protect. **An order based on fear and allegiance, or an order based on justice and responsibility**. Intelligence does not merely defend this choice: it embodies it.

This choice is a long-term commitment. Loyalty guarantees the immediate survival of power. Only trust allows a political order to endure without betraying itself.
