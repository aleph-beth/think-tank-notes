# From Corinth to Brussels
## Cultural centrality, loss of decision-making power, and imperial logic

# Introduction — Analogy as a tool for historical understanding

History never repeats itself mechanically. Instead, it provides **comparable structures**, recurring configurations in which different societies, at distant times, find themselves confronted with similar tensions between culture, power, and decision-making. It is in this context that the analogy proposed here between ancient Greece and contemporary Europe, between Corinth and Brussels, between Rome and the United States, fits in.

The aim is neither to predict a destiny nor to assign an inevitable trajectory. It is to use history as an **instrument of intelligibility**, not as a tribunal of the present. The analogy is not based on the identity of facts, but on the homology of functions: it highlights the structural relationships between cultural centrality, normative governance, and strategic decision-making capacity.

The Greek world at the end of the Hellenistic period offers a particularly illuminating precedent. Even though its culture remained dominant and its intellectual language permeated the entire Mediterranean world, Greece gradually lost control of political decision-making. This dissociation between symbolic authority and effective power was at the heart of the shift that led, in 146 BC, to the destruction of Corinth—not as a mere military episode, but as the final act of a political system that had become incompatible with the Roman imperial order.

Contemporary Europe finds itself, relatively speaking, in a similar situation. It remains a major normative center, producing laws, standards, and universal values. But its ability to decide, to make judgments, and to impose an autonomous strategic direction appears increasingly constrained, dependent, or circumvented. European governance functions, often with great sophistication, without always being the final decision-making authority.

From this perspective, the analogy with Rome and the United States is not intended to denounce domination, but to understand a **logic of power**. Rome in the past, like the United States today, did not seek to destroy the cultures it dominated. It integrated, used, and sometimes magnified them. What it always refused, however, was prolonged political ambiguity and structural indecision in areas it considered to be its strategic responsibility.

This work therefore adopts a dual perspective. That of the historian, attentive to long continuities, silent ruptures, and functions rather than discourse. And that of the think tank, concerned with illuminating the present without moralizing, by identifying tipping points, plausible scenarios, and implicit choices.

The question that runs through this analysis is simple in its formulation but fraught with consequences: **what becomes of a civilization that continues to structure the language of the world without structuring its decisions?**

The following pages attempt to provide some answers to this question, bringing together the ancient world and the present, not to confuse them, but to reveal the lines of force that connect them.

# PART I — History of Corinth before its destruction

## Centrality without sovereignty

### I.1. Corinth as a functional city of the Greek world

Located on the isthmus connecting mainland Greece to the Peloponnese, **Corinth** occupies a geographical position unmatched in the ancient Greek world. This narrow strip of land controlled both north-south land communications and east-west maritime traffic, thanks to its two ports opening onto the Aegean and Ionian Seas respectively. This configuration gave the city a major strategic role, not through conquest, but through control of traffic flows.

From the Archaic period onwards, Corinth established itself as a major economic and commercial hub. It channeled trade between the Greek East, the Mediterranean West, and the interior of the Hellenic peninsula. Its prosperity was based on trade, crafts, and the movement of goods and people.
 
This wealth, often commented on by ancient authors, was not the product of a territorial empire, but of a functional centrality.

Unlike Athens or Sparta, Corinth did not base its prestige on a singular political, philosophical, or military doctrine. It did not claim to embody a universal model of government or civic virtue. Its vocation was above all that of a city of passage, intermediation, and mediation. Corinth was not a city that spoke on behalf of the Greek world; it was a city through which the Greek world circulated.

### I.2. Corinth and indirect Greek governance

This central role is exemplified by the organization of the Isthmian Games. The second largest Panhellenic gathering after Olympia, these games made Corinth a regular meeting place for Greek cities. They were a religious, sporting, and diplomatic event, promoting truces, exchanges, and mutual recognition between rival political communities.

Corinth thus participated in a form of indirect Greek governance based not on domination but on coordination. It did not impose ideological hegemony comparable to that of Athens, nor military supremacy in the manner of Sparta. This absence of doctrinal pretensions allowed it to play a relatively neutral interface role, acceptable to the entire Greek world.

In this context, Corinth functioned as a pan-Hellenic platform: it welcomed, connected, and facilitated. Its legitimacy stemmed from its ability to maintain the material and symbolic conditions for Greek coexistence, rather than from imposing a particular political vision. This centrality, however, remained fundamentally dependent on the overall balance of the city-state system.

---

### I.3. Deterioration of relations with Rome

Rome's entry into Greek affairs profoundly altered this balance. In 196 BC, the solemn proclamation of the “freedom of the Greeks” by the Roman general Flamininus during the Isthmian Games held in Corinth marked a turning point. Rome presented itself as a liberating power, guaranteeing the autonomy of the cities after the defeat of Macedonia.

In the decades that followed, Rome exercised control without direct administration. The Greek cities retained their institutions, but their strategic decisions were now subject to Roman arbitration. This ambiguous situation fueled a lasting misunderstanding: the Greeks continued to think of themselves as autonomous political actors, while Rome considered the Greek world to be stabilized under its authority.

The rise of tensions with the Achaean League crystallized this discrepancy. In seeking to reaffirm collective sovereignty in the face of Roman interventions, the League underestimated the real balance of power. Corinth, with its central position and pan-Hellenic prestige, became the focal point of these tensions. In Rome's eyes, the city no longer embodied a useful interface, but a potential hotbed of symbolic protest.

---

### I.4. 146 BC: destruction and upheaval

The destruction of Corinth in 146 BC was not a response to any immediate military necessity. The city, having been defeated, no longer posed a strategic threat. Rome's action was primarily a political and symbolic decision. By destroying Corinth, Rome was not merely punishing a revolt: it was eliminating a platform for coordination that had become incompatible with its mode of domination.

This destruction targeted the functional heart of the Greek world. Corinth, as a crossroads, gathering place, and pan-Hellenic interface, made possible the illusion of collective Greek autonomy. Its eradication marked the end of this illusion. Greek culture survived, but it was now integrated into an imperial order that no longer tolerated independent mediation.

146 BC thus marks a major historical turning point. The Greek world ceases to exist as an autonomous political system; it becomes an administered space, culturally prestigious but politically subordinate.

---

### Conclusion of Part I

Corinth does not fall as a classic enemy of Rome, but as a function that has become incompatible with the Empire. Its centrality, once the guarantor of Greek circulation and balance, became an obstacle when imperial power demanded unambiguous decision-making. The destruction of Corinth reveals less the violence of conquest than the structural logic of a world that no longer tolerates autonomous interfaces.

# PART II — Structural parallels between ancient Greece and contemporary Europe

## Cultural centrality in the face of loss of decision-making power

### II.1. Greece: dominant culture, declining power

From the 2nd century BC onwards, the Greek world retained unparalleled intellectual and symbolic prestige. Greek philosophy, arts, sciences, rhetoric, and political forms continued to shape the imagination of the Mediterranean world, including among the Roman elites. This cultural domination was real, profound, and lasting.

However, this prestige was no longer accompanied by autonomous military or strategic power. The Greek cities, fragmented and demographically weakened, depended on the protection or arbitration of external powers. Security, war, and ultimate decision-making gradually slipped from the Greek world's grasp.

In this context, an illusion of sovereignty based on speech, law, and debate emerged. The Greeks continued to deliberate, proclaim principles, and mobilize a political vocabulary inherited from the classical era, even though the balance of power had shifted. Speech remained sovereign in appearance, but it no longer produced decisions.

---

### II.2. Contemporary Europe: norms without a sword

Contemporary Europe occupies a structurally comparable position. It remains a major normative center: European law, regulation, technical standards, and moral and legal principles largely shape the international order. This legal and regulatory centrality gives Europe considerable symbolic and procedural authority.

However, this normative power is not based on unified military sovereignty. Defense capabilities remain fragmented, dependent on external alliances, and insufficiently integrated to guarantee complete strategic autonomy. Decisions on security, force projection, and major crisis management often fall outside the European framework.

The result is structural external strategic dependence. Like Greece vis-à-vis Rome, Europe retains control of language, but not of the sword. It can describe, regulate, and judge, but struggles to make decisions when the balance of power becomes decisive.

---

### II.3. Corinth and Brussels: the same functional position

Corinth in late ancient Greece and Brussels in contemporary Europe occupy a comparable functional position. Both act as coordination platforms: places of circulation, negotiation, arbitration, and standard-setting.

Their legitimacy is based primarily on procedures, mediation mechanisms, and the ability to organize the coexistence of multiple actors. They structure flows, but do not have ultimate decision-making power based on coercion.

This weakness in decision-making is not an accident, but a direct consequence of their function. As platforms rather than sovereign centers, Corinth and Brussels embody centrality without their own coercive capacity. As long as the general balance is accepted, this position is an asset. When it breaks down, it becomes a vulnerability.

---

### II.4. The European misunderstanding

At the heart of the European misunderstanding lies the confusion between normative centrality and real political sovereignty. Europe tends to equate its ability to produce legitimate norms, rules, and discourse with an effective capacity for strategic decision-making.

However, as in the case of Greece, this centrality does not guarantee autonomy. The persistence of a discourse of autonomy, not backed by sufficient coercive means, maintains an illusion of control. It masks the fact that, in critical moments, the decision belongs to those who have the capacity to act.

---

### Conclusion of Part II

Like ancient Greece on the eve of the destruction of Corinth, contemporary Europe influences the world through its culture, standards, and political language. But it no longer fully structures it through decision-making. This dissociation between symbolic authority and effective power is the central point of tension in its current historical situation.

# PART III — American reaction: parallels between the United States and ancient Rome

## From protective ally to closing authority

### III.1. Rome versus Greece

Rome's relationship with the Greek world was initially characterized by deep cultural admiration. The Roman elites adopted the Greek language, its artistic forms, its philosophy, and its educational models. In Rome's eyes, Greece remained the intellectual matrix of Mediterranean civilization. This admiration was neither feigned nor superficial; it had a lasting impact on Roman culture.

However, this cultural recognition was not accompanied by an acceptance of Greek political ambiguity. Rome found it difficult to tolerate a space where sovereignty was diffuse, where decisions were constantly renegotiated, and where words were used to replace action. As Rome consolidated its power, it perceived this indeterminacy as a factor of instability.

The relationship then evolved from arbitration to unilateral decision-making. As long as Greece accepted Roman mediation, Rome acted as arbitrator. When Greece contested or delayed decisions, Rome made the final call. The destruction of Corinth was the culmination of this shift: not a rejection of Greek culture, but the elimination of a political space deemed ungovernable.

---

### III.2. The United States and Europe

The relationship between the United States and contemporary Europe has a similar structure. The United States largely incorporates European standards when they reinforce the stability of the international order, facilitate trade, or legitimize useful legal frameworks. European law, technical standards, and certain regulations are then incorporated into a broader system dominated by American power.

On the other hand, when these standards become restrictive for strategic action, they are circumvented. Multilateral mechanisms are relativized, procedures are accelerated or shifted to bilateral or informal frameworks. The standard is accepted only as long as it does not hinder the capacity to act.

In this model, primacy is given to strategic effectiveness. Legitimacy derives less from procedural compliance than from the ability to produce rapid and stabilizing results. Like Rome in the past, the United States clearly distinguishes between Europe's cultural and normative usefulness and its ability to make decisions in critical situations.

---

III.3. A common imperial logic

Rome and the United States share the same imperial logic, independent of specific historical contexts. This logic is based on tolerance of mediation as long as it facilitates the management of the dominated space. Coordination platforms, allies, and normative bodies are accepted as instruments of stabilization.

On the other hand, obstruction is intolerable. As soon as mediation slows down, complicates, or challenges the central decision, it ceases to be an asset and becomes a problem. The Empire, whatever its face, favors the rapid closure of areas of indecision.

This closure can take various forms: physical destruction in antiquity, institutional circumvention, or strategic marginalization in the contemporary era. In all cases, the objective is the same: to restore a clear chain of decision-making.

---

### III.4. The Corinthian moment / the European moment

The Corinthian moment occurs when the platform ceases to behave as a simple space for coordination and begins to speak as an autonomous political actor. By implicitly challenging the Roman decision, Corinth crosses a threshold that the Empire cannot accept.

The European moment is similar. When European institutions claim to set strategic guidelines without having the corresponding coercive means at their disposal, they come into conflict with the American hegemon. The reaction is not direct confrontation, but decision-making without real negotiation.

In both cases, the hegemon does not argue at length. It decides. The discussion ceases not because it is illegitimate, but because it has become incompatible with the need for action.

---

### Conclusion of Part III

Rome, like the United States, does not destroy the culture it dominates. They absorb it, enhance it, and use it. What they take away, however, is the right to decide. The loss of sovereignty does not come through symbolic erasure, but through the effective closure of political decision-making.

# PART IV — The End of European Governance

## Dissolution, circumvention, or transformation

### IV.1. What “the end of governance” means

Talking about “the end of European governance” does not mean the disappearance of institutions or the legal collapse of the Union. Administrative, regulatory, and procedural structures can endure for a long time, sometimes even becoming formally strengthened. History shows that political systems rarely decline through the sudden abolition of their institutions.

The end of governance must be understood as a loss of decision-making centrality. The places where standards, regulations, and compromises are developed cease to be the places where crucial decisions are made. The essentials shift elsewhere: to restricted circles, ad hoc alliances, or extra-European frameworks.

In this configuration, governance is gradually reduced to the administration of what has already been decided. It manages the consequences of strategic choices made outside its sphere, without any real power over their direction. This disconnect produces procedural inflation that masks, without canceling out, the loss of effective sovereignty.

---

### IV.2. Possible scenarios

#### 1. The Corinthian scenario

This scenario corresponds to a gradual marginalization of European governance. The institutions remain, but their role becomes essentially symbolic. Europe survives as a normative, cultural, and legal heritage, widely integrated and sometimes invoked, but without the capacity to structure the strategic order.

Like Greece after 146 BC, Europe would continue to influence the world with its concepts, rules, and values, while being bypassed as soon as decisions involving power relations are made. Its centrality would become more memorial than operational.

#### 2. The Byzantine scenario

In this scenario, European governance retains a strong administrative centrality. It becomes a sophisticated management center, capable of maintaining a complex, stable, and legally coherent internal order, but disconnected from power.

This model evokes a long, stabilized decline: the governing apparatus functions, sometimes with remarkable efficiency, but no longer commands the strategic environment. Institutional survival is ensured at the cost of a lasting loss of real influence.

#### 3. The strategic transformation scenario

The third scenario assumes a conscious break with the current trajectory. It involves converting the norm into capacity, i.e., translating European regulatory and economic power into effective strategic instruments.

This transformation requires the explicit reintegration of power relations into governance: rapid decision-making capacity, credible strategic autonomy, and a clear link between law, economics, and security. Europe would not renounce its normative centrality, but would subordinate it to a capacity for real action.

---

### IV.3. The historic tipping point

The present moment is no longer a matter of moral or legal debate. European principles, values, and standards are known, formulated, and widely disseminated. The question is now structural and decision-making.

History teaches us that political systems that no longer make decisions always end up being circumvented. This circumvention may be gradual, discreet, and non-confrontational, but it is inexorable once decision-making shifts permanently away from the proclaimed center.

---

# General conclusion — Analogy as a historical warning

The analogy between Corinth and Brussels, between ancient Greece and contemporary Europe, between Rome and the United States, is not intended to predict a mechanical destiny or to formulate a prophecy. It aims to shed light on a recurring pattern in history: the gradual dissociation between cultural centrality and decision-making capacity.

History shows that civilizations do not disappear when they cease to be powerful, but when they cease to be decisive. Greece was not destroyed as a culture; it was integrated, absorbed, transmitted. What disappeared, however, was its ability to politically organize the world it had helped to shape. Corinth embodies that precise moment when a mediating function, having become autonomous without the corresponding power, is perceived as incompatible with an imperial order.

Contemporary Europe finds itself in a similar situation. It remains a major normative, intellectual, and legal center. Its concepts permeate the international order, its standards structure trade, and its values continue to be invoked.
 
But this centrality alone no longer guarantees control over strategic decision-making. When the balance of power prevails, norms are circumvented, mediation is curtailed, and decisions are displaced.

Rome yesterday, like the United States today, does not seek to destroy the culture it dominates. They recognize its usefulness, richness, and symbolic legitimacy. What they do not tolerate, however, is prolonged indecision, political ambiguity, or procedural challenges when action is deemed necessary. The Empire decides where the platform deliberates.

The challenge for Europe is therefore neither moral nor legal. It is historical and structural. A political system can talk for a long time without deciding; it can even prosper symbolically in this position. But history teaches us that it always ends up being bypassed when it is no longer the place where decisions are made.

The analogy offered here is not one of resignation, but of lucidity. It reminds us that cultural centrality can only be maintained in the long term if it is linked to a real capacity for action and decision-making. Without this link, the risk is not collapse, but a silent transformation into a legacy—prestigious and respected, but politically secondary.

This is where Europe stands today: between survival as a global language and regaining the ability to shape its course.
