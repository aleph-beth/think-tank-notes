# From Rome to Washington: Integrate, Contain, Destroy

## An Imperial Grammar of Power

---

# General Introduction

The history of empires reveals one constant: no lasting power can rule the world by force alone. All stable domination relies on the ability to differentiate, prioritize, and adapt its modes of action in the face of diverse peoples, cultures, and political systems.

From the Roman Empire to the contemporary international order dominated by the United States and structured around the European Union, institutional forms have changed, but the fundamental constraints remain. Integrate Integrating, containing, neutralizing, deterring: these logics constitute the deep grammar of power.

This report offers a comparative reading of the Roman experience and current geopolitical configurations in order to identify a model of strategic analysis applicable to relations with the unyielding actors of the 21st century, in particular China, Russia, and Iran.

The objective is neither prescriptive nor ideological. The aim is to provide a framework for understanding that can inform decision-making in an environment marked by fragmentation, systemic rivalry, and the end of universalist illusions.

By drawing on history, political theory, and contemporary analysis, this work aims to restore a form of strategic lucidity: the primary condition for any lasting power.

# PART I — The Roman Matrix: Governing Otherness

## Introduction

The Roman Empire was the first large-scale political system to develop a coherent and sustainable doctrine for managing otherness. Contrary to a simplistic interpretation that reduces Rome to a purely conquering power, its strategic genius lay in its ability to differentiate modes of domination according to context, peoples, and associated costs.

Rome did not systematically seek to destroy. It arbitrated between integration, peripheral control, and selective annihilation. This imperial rationality established a model that can still be observed in contemporary strategies.

---

## 1. Rome as the imperial center

Rome was not defined solely as an administrative capital. It was a symbolic, normative, and military center.

Main functions:

* Political and legal center
* Source of imperial legitimacy
* Logistical and financial hub
* Producer of norms

The periphery is structured around this center, with varying degrees of autonomy.

---

## 2. The three Roman responses to otherness

Rome developed an operational typology of external peoples very early on.

### 2.1 Integration (Romanization)

Objective: to transform the enemy into loyal subjects.

Means:

* Gradual granting of citizenship
* Co-opting of local elites
* Urbanization and infrastructure
* Dissemination of Roman law

Result: long-term stabilization.

---

### 2.2 Containment (Border and deterrence)

Objective: to contain a non-integratable actor.

Means:

* Limes and fortifications
* Permanent garrisons
* Punitive raids
* Tribal diplomacy

Result: risk management without annexation.

---

### 2.3 Destruction (Strategic annihilation)

Objective: eliminate a structural threat.

Means:

* Prolonged sieges
* Deportations
* Destruction of elites
* Subsequent colonization

Result: political eradication of the targeted group.

---

## 3. Criteria for imperial decision-making

Rome does not choose arbitrarily. Its decisions are based on a systemic assessment.

Main criteria:

* Cultural integrability
* Military cost
* Economic value
* Capacity for harm
* Sustainability of resistance

These variables determine the mode of intervention.

---

## 4. Roman toolbox

Imperial action always combines several levers.

* Targeted terror
* Indirect diplomacy
* Subsidies and tributes
* Political hostages
* Military colonies
* Infrastructure
* Divide and rule

Rome favors the hybridization of means rather than their exclusivity.

---

## 5. 
Results and limitations of the model

### 5.1 Performance

* Centuries-long stability
* Relatively low cost of governance
* Exceptional absorption capacity

### 5.2 Weaknesses

* Dependence on local elites
* Growing financial pressure
* Militarization of borders
* Late bureaucratization

These limitations explain the gradual erosion of the system.

---

## Conclusion of Part I

The Roman matrix is based on a fundamental principle: governing otherness requires constant strategic differentiation. The Empire survives not through brute force, but through the intelligence of its decisions.

This model constitutes the founding grammar of subsequent powers.

---

# PART II — General theory: governing the unintegratable

## Introduction

Sooner or later, every imperial power encounters actors that it can neither absorb permanently nor neutralize definitively. These actors form the category of unintegratable systems.

This part proposes a cross-cutting theoretical framework for analyzing these configurations beyond the Roman case alone.

---

## 6. Typology of unintegratable actors

### 6.1 Fragmented actors

Characteristics:

* Absence of stable central authority
* Multiple loyalties
* Political volatility

Imperial response: clientelism, mediation, partial co-optation.

---

### 6.2 Ideological actors

Characteristics:

* Legitimacy based on doctrine
* Low normative permeability
* Identity mobilization

Imperial response: containment, deterrence, technical negotiation.

---

### 6.3 Civilization states

Characteristics:

* Historical continuity
* Cultural autonomy
* Non-negotiable sovereignty

Imperial response: systemic rivalry, decoupling, balance of power.

---

### 6.4 Hybrid actors

Characteristics:

* Combination of state, militias, and networks
* Legal ambiguity
* Indirect projection

Imperial response: targeted degradation, counter-networks, information warfare.

---

## 7. The figure of the enduring barbarian

Definition: an actor too strong to be absorbed, too costly to be destroyed.

Properties:

* Minimal economic autonomy
* Social resilience
* Capacity for asymmetric harm
* Stabilized identity

These actors impose a structurally conflictual relationship.

---

## 8. Political economy of domination

Any imperial strategy is based on a cost/benefit analysis.

Key variables:

* Cost of occupation
* Cost of reconstruction
* Reputational cost
* Opportunity cost

Imperial rationality is above all budgetary.

---

## 9. Mechanisms of attrition and transformation

### 9.1 External attrition

* Sanctions
* Blockade
* Normative isolation

---

### 9.2 Internal attrition

* Elite fragmentation
* Socio-economic pressure
* Conflicts of legitimacy

---

### 9.3 Slow transformation

* Technological dependencies
* Commercial interdependencies
* Normative socialization

---

## 10. Universal decision-making matrix

| Variable | Low | Medium | High |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| Integratability | Annex | Clientelize | Contain |
| Resilience | Pressure | Attrition | Deterrence |
| Dangerousness | Surveillance | Degradation | Coalition |
| Autonomy | Integrate | Negotiate | Compete |

---

## Conclusion of Part II

Governing the unintegratable is not about imposing total control, but about managing an unstable balance between pressure, deterrence, and adaptation. Sustainable empires are those that know how to transform insoluble conflicts into regimes of coexistence under tension.

---

# PART III — The United States as “Late Rome”

## Introduction

Since the end of World War II, the United States has occupied a position structurally comparable to that of Rome in late antiquity: the military, financial, normative, and technological center of a hierarchical international system.

However, unlike classical Rome, American power is exercised without direct territorial annexation and is based on networks, alliances, and interdependencies.

This section analyzes the United States as a form of late empire, based on projection rather than formal integration.

---

## 11. Washington as the imperial center

Washington is the central decision-making hub of the Western system.

Main functions:

* Military strategic direction
* Global financial management
* Normative production
* Technological leadership

American power is distributed through institutions, bases, and partnerships.

---

## 12. Contemporary imperial architecture

### 12.1 Alliance networks

* NATO
* Bilateral partnerships
* Defense agreements

These networks play a role similar to that of Roman client provinces and kingdoms.

---

### 12.2 Military projection

* Forward bases
* Fleets
* Expeditionary forces
* Nuclear deterrence

The American border is mobile and global.

---

### 12.3 Financial domination

* Dollar as reserve currency
* Payment systems
* Extraterritorial sanctions

Monetary leverage largely replaces traditional imperial taxation.

---

## 13. Post-Cold War transformation

### 13.1 Unipolar moment

After 1991, the United States exercised virtually unchallenged hegemony.

Characteristics:

* Direct interventions
* Normative expansion
* Expanded integration

---

### 13.2 Crises of expansion

* Iraq
* Afghanistan
* Syria

These conflicts reveal the limits of forced transformation.

---

### 13.3 Transition to a network empire

Faced with the excessive costs of occupation, Washington favors:

* Drones
* Special forces
* Proxies
* sanctions

---

## 14. Contemporary tools of imperial management

The United States mobilizes a combination of instruments.

* Technological superiority
* Global intelligence
* Cyberwarfare
* Information warfare
* Coercive diplomacy

This system is gradually replacing territorial occupation.

---

## 15. Structural tensions of the late empire

### 15.1 Strategic overload

* Multiplication of fronts
* Domestic fatigue
* Budgetary costs

---

### 15.2 Internal polarization

* Political fragmentation
* Social unrest
* Institutional crises

---

### 15.3 Systemic protest

* Rise of rival powers
* Partial de-dollarization
* Normative conflicts

---

## 16. Comparison between late Rome and the United States

| Variable | Late Rome | United States |
| ---------- | ---------- -- | ----------- |
| Borders | Fixed | Mobile |
| Army | Permanent | Projected |
| Taxation | Territorial | Financial |
| Allies | Federates | Partners |
| Legitimacy | Imperial | Liberal |

---

## Conclusion of Part III

The United States embodies a form of late empire based on connectivity, finance, and technology rather than direct territorial domination. Like Rome in its final phase, it must arbitrate between expansion, stabilization, and internal preservation.

Its ability to maintain this balance will determine the geopolitical configuration of the 21st century.

---

# PART IV — China, Russia, Iran: Irreducible Blocs

## Introduction

The contemporary international system is structured by the emergence of political, cultural, and strategic blocs that remain permanently outside the logic of 
Western integration. China, Russia, and Iran embody three distinct forms of systemic irreducibility.

These actors are neither ordinary revisionist states nor peripheral powers. They constitute autonomous systems capable of resisting, absorbing, and circumventing external pressures.

---

## 17. China: Civilization-state

### 17.1 Structural foundations

* Millennia of historical continuity
* Bureaucratic centrality
* Civilizational nationalism
* Political-technological control

China sees itself less as a Westphalian state than as an organized civilization.

---

### 17.2 Strategic autonomy

* Integrated industrial chains
* Digital sovereignty
* Endogenous innovation capacity
* Global economic projection

This autonomy limits the effectiveness of traditional coercive levers.

---

### 17.3 Western response

* Partial decoupling
* Technological competition
* Regional containment
* Multilateral diplomacy

Sino-Western relations are characterized by lasting structural rivalry.

---

## 18. Russia: imperial fortress

### 18.1 Strategic heritage

* Culture of territorial depth
* Security centralization
* Memory of invasions
* Military-administrative state

Russia has historically functioned as a power of resistance.

---

### 18.2 Logic of defensive sovereignty

* Priority given to border control
* Energy instrumentalization
* Political militarization
* Information autonomy

This logic makes any external subordination unacceptable.

---

### 18.3 Western response

* Massive sanctions
* Indirect support for adversaries
* Regional rearmament
* Diplomatic isolation

The objective is strategic attrition rather than integration.

---

## 19. Iran: A locked ideological state

### 19.1 Architecture of the regime

* Religious legitimacy
* Dual system (civil/religious)
* Dense security apparatus
* Transnational networks

The Iranian regime is based on strong internal ideological coherence.

---

### 19.2 Structural resilience

* Sanctions economy
* Identity mobilization
* Capacity for indirect harm
* Institutional adaptation

These mechanisms neutralize external overthrow strategies.

---

### 19.3 Western response

* Prolonged containment
* Targeted sanctions
* Covert actions
* Technical negotiations

The objective is to limit capabilities rather than bring about political transformation.

---

## 20. Systemic comparison of irreducible blocs

| Variable | China | Russia | Iran |
| --------------------- | ------------ | -------- --- | ----------- |
| Type | Civilization | Fortress | Ideology |
| Autonomy | Very strong | Strong | Medium |
| Resilience | High | High | High |
| Integratability | Low | Very low | None |
| Western strategy | Rivalry | Attrition | Containment |

---

## 21. Logic of the new “systemic barbarians”

These three actors occupy the position of sustainable barbarians in the contemporary system.

Common characteristics:

* Rejection of normative dependence
* Ability to circumvent
* Construction of alternative narratives
* Parallel networks

They impose a fragmented multipolar order.

---

## 22. Effects on the international order

* End of normative universality
* Fragmentation of value chains
* Proliferation of gray areas
* Institutionalization of hybrid conflict

The system is evolving toward a stabilized state of conflictual coexistence.

---

## Conclusion of Part IV

China, Russia, and Iran cannot be integrated or marginalized in the long term. They constitute poles of strategic autonomy that force Western powers to abandon any illusion of universalization.

The management of these blocs relies on balance, deterrence, and prolonged competition rather than political transformation.

---

# PART V — Europe, Corinth, and the Normative Empire

## Introduction

The European Union is a unique historical case: a major economic and normative power without unified military sovereignty. It exercises a form of imperial influence based not on conquest, but on the production of rules, standards, and legal frameworks.

In this configuration, Brussels occupies a function analogous to that of Corinth in the Roman Empire: an operational center of flows, without being the ultimate sovereign center.

---

## 23. Brussels as a normative center

### 23.1 Institutional concentration

* European Commission
* European Parliament
* Council of the European Union
* Specialized agencies
* Lobbying networks

Brussels concentrates the capacity to formulate European standards.

---

### 23.2 Power through rules

* Market regulation
* Legal harmonization
* Technical standardization
* Competition policy
* Data protection

European influence is based on the export of its standards.

---

## 24. Corinth: historical precedent

### 24.1 Ancient economic function

* Mediterranean trade hub
* Logistics hub
* Regional financial center
* Tax platform

Corinth structured flows more than it commanded politically.

---

### 24.2 Strategic dependence

* Roman military protection
* Political subordination
* Geopolitical vulnerability

This dependence limited its real autonomy.

---

## 25. Europe as a regulatory empire

### 25.1 Logic of integration

* Single market
* Free movement
* Convergence programs
* Legal conditionality

The EU transforms through access rather than coercion.

---

### 25.2 Non-military neutralization

* Economic sanctions
* Legal disputes
* Financial pressure
* Compliance mechanisms

Europe favors the judicialization of conflict.

---

## 26. Structural limitations of the European model

### 26.1 Lack of strategic sovereignty

* Security dependence
* Military fragmentation
* Heterogeneity of interests

---

### 26.2 Slow decision-making

* Complex consensus
* Multiple vetoes
* Bureaucratic weight

---

### 26.3 Hybrid vulnerabilities

* Cyberattacks
* Information interference
* Energy dependencies
* Migration pressures

---

## 27. Europe and intractable blocs

The EU adopts an intermediate stance toward China, Russia, and Iran.

* Partial alignment with the United States
* Limited strategic autonomy
* Economic diplomacy
* Seeking mediation

This position reflects a power without the capacity for direct coercion.

---

## 28. Comparison between Corinth and Brussels

| Variable | Corinth | Brussels |
| ---------- --- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Status | Economic hub | Normative hub |
| Sovereignty | Weak | Fragmented |
| Protection | Rome | NATO/US |
| Power | Flows | Rules |
| Vulnerability | Military | Political |

---

## 29. Possible trajectories for Europe

### 29.1 Strategic reinforcement

* Common defense
* Industrial policy
* Energy autonomy

---

### 29.2 Maintaining the normative model

* Priority to law
* Regulatory leadership
* Institutional soft power

---

### 29.3 Relative marginalization

* Increased dependence
* Decline in influence
* Internal fragmentation

---

## Conclusion of Part V

Europe today functions like a contemporary Corinth: an indispensable regulatory center, but structurally dependent. Its strategic future will depend on its ability to transform its normative power into sovereign capacity for action.

---

# PART VI — Decision-making model and strategic matrix

## Introduction

Following the historical, theoretical, and geopolitical analysis, this part proposes an operational framework enabling decision-makers to guide their choices when faced with actors who are integrable, unintegrable, or irreducible.

The aim is to formalize a decision-making grammar based on measurable variables and rational trade-offs.

---

## 30. Fundamental decision-making variables

Any imperial strategy is based on the simultaneous assessment of several dimensions.

### 30.1 Political integrability

* Existence of co-optable elites
* Normative acceptability
* Capacity for internal mediation

---

### 30.2 Structural resilience

* Economic autonomy
* Capacity for substitution
* Institutional robustness

---

### 30.3 Capacity for harm

* Military potential
* Indirect projection
* Cyber and information
* Capacity for destabilization

---

### 30.4 Overall cost of intervention

* Military cost
* Economic cost
* Internal political cost
* Reputational cost

---

## 31. Typology of strategic environments

| Environment | Integratability | Resilience | Dangerousness | Cost |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Cooperative | High | Low | Low | Low |
| Clientelizable | Medium | Low | Medium | Moderate |
| Irreducible | Low | High | High | High |
| Existential | None | Very high | Very high | Critical |

---

## 32. Strategic action matrix

| Target profile | Main option | Dominant tools | Purpose |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------- ---------- |
| Integratable | Integration | Aid, standards, exchanges | Stabilization |
| Clientelizable | Delegation | Elite support, agreements | Indirect control |
| Irreducible | Containment | Sanctions, deterrence | Limitation |
| Existential | Maximum deterrence | Coalitions, superiority | Systemic survival |

---

## 33. Strategic sequencing

An effective strategy is always progressive.

### 33.1 Exploration phase

* Mapping of actors
* Network analysis
* Identification of levers

---

### 33.2 Testing phase

* Limited pressure
* Targeted incentives
* Diplomatic signals

---

### 33.3 Stabilization phase

* Institutionalization
* Sustainable agreements
* Monitoring mechanisms

---

### 33.4 Hardening phase

* Expanded sanctions
* Isolation
* Targeted degradation

---

## 34. Escalation risk management

Any imperial decision carries systemic risk.

Aggravating factors:

* Strategic ambiguities
* Multiplication of actors
* Reputation effects
* Escalation logic

Stabilization mechanisms:

* Crisis channels
* Explicit red lines
* Third-party mediation
* Confidence-building measures

---

## 35. Strategic performance indicators

The effectiveness of a policy must be continuously evaluated.

Key indicators:

* Reduction of adversarial capabilities
* Regional stability
* Controlled budgetary cost
* Domestic acceptability
* International credibility

---

## 36. Limitations of the decision-making model

* Information uncertainty
* Cognitive biases of elites
* Democratic constraints
* Unintended effects

No matrix can eliminate political risk.

---

## Conclusion of Part VI

The proposed decision-making model aims to transform strategic intuition into a rational process. It does not provide automatic solutions, but rather a framework for arbitration that limits structural errors.

The quality of an empire is not measured by its brute force, but by its ability to make clear-headed decisions under pressure.

---

# PART VII — General conclusion: From imperial grammar to strategic lucidity

## Introduction

This study has used Roman history as an analytical matrix to develop a general grammar of power. From antiquity to the contemporary international order, forms change, but structural constraints remain.

Integrate, contain, neutralize, deter: these four verbs have long organized the conduct of empires.

---

## 37. Fundamental historical continuities

Despite technological and institutional ruptures, several constants are found in all imperial systems:

* Centrality of flow control
* Importance of intermediate elites
* Permanent cost/benefit arbitration
* Primacy of stability over ideology
* Differentiated management of peripheries

Rome, Washington, and Brussels operate in different forms, but within a similar framework of constraints.

---

## 38. End of the universalist illusion

The contemporary era marks the gradual end of the project for a homogeneous world order.

Irreducible blocs demonstrate:

* the persistence of political civilizations,
* the resistance of hard sovereignties,
* the enduring plurality of norms.

Normative universalization is no longer a realistic prospect, but a potential source of conflict.

---

## 39. Towards a world of conflictual coexistence

The international system is evolving towards a model based on:

* stabilized spheres of influence,
* technological rivalries,
* functional borders,
* permanent hybrid conflicts.

This model corresponds to a form of regulated barbaric multipolarity.

---

## 40. Specific challenges for the West

### 40.1 For the United States

* Limit strategic overload
* Preserve internal cohesion
* Prioritize critical theaters
* Avoid interventionist hubris

---

### 40.2 For Europe

* Transform normative power into strategic capacity
* Reduce critical dependencies
* Strengthen political coherence
* Clarify red lines

---

## 41. Cross-cutting recommendations

Several guiding principles emerge from the model developed:

1. Do not seek to integrate the unintegratable
2. Do not underestimate the cost of containment
3. Preserve channels of stabilization
4. Invest in internal resilience
5. Strictly prioritize

Strategic lucidity takes precedence over normative idealism.

---

## 42. Limitations and extensions

This work does not claim to provide a universal doctrine, but rather an interpretive framework.

Limitations:

* Uncertainty of data
* Technological acceleration
* Unpredictable societal factors

Possible extensions:

* Analysis of cyberspace as a new imperial frontier
* Study of global non-state actors
* Impact of artificial intelligence on strategic decision-making

---

## Final conclusion

From Rome to Washington, via Brussels, lasting power relies less on domination than on mastery of balances.

The empires that survive are those that know how to renounce the illusion of total control, accept the plurality of political worlds, and organize conflict rather than claim to abolish it.

In a fragmented 21st century, strategic lucidity becomes the primary resource of power.
