# History of Ancient Greece and its relations with Ancient Rome

## Introduction

The history of Ancient Greece is one of the major foundations of Western civilization, spanning more than two millennia and profoundly influencing the political, philosophical, artistic, and scientific fields. This brilliant civilization, whose influence extended far beyond its geographical borders, had complex relations with Rome, oscillating between military confrontation and cultural fusion. The Latin poet Horace perfectly sums up this paradox: “Defeated Greece seized its fierce conqueror and brought the arts to wild Latium.” This study examines the evolution of Greek civilization from its Mycenaean origins to its absorption into the Roman Empire, analyzing the mechanisms of this encounter that gave birth to Greco-Roman civilization.

## The foundations of Greek civilization

### Mycenaean civilization (1650-1200 BC)

Mycenaean civilization represents the first great Greek culture, developing in the Peloponnese from around 1650 BC. This palatial society, centered on fortified citadels such as Mycenae, Tiryns, and Pylos, mastered the production of bronze and developed a warrior, peasant, and trading economy. Around 1450 BC, the Mycenaeans conquered Minoan Crete and settled in the palace of Knossos, where the earliest traces of Mycenaean writing, Linear B, appear, transcribing an ancient form of Greek.

Linear B, deciphered by Michael Ventris and John Chadwick in 1952, revealed that the Mycenaeans already worshipped several deities familiar from the classical period: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Athena, Artemis, and Dionysus. This religious continuity testifies to the deep roots of Greek culture from this period onwards. Mycenaean civilization reached its peak between 1400 and 1200 BC, during which time it dominated maritime trade in the eastern Mediterranean.

### The collapse of the Bronze Age and the Dark Ages

Around 1200 BC, Mycenaean civilization collapsed as part of a widespread crisis affecting the entire eastern Mediterranean. This period, marked by massive destruction, the disappearance of writing, and population decline, remains the subject of debate. Possible causes include invasions by the Sea Peoples, climate change causing prolonged droughts, earthquakes, internal revolts, and dynastic strife.

The Mycenaean collapse plunged Greece into what historians call the “Dark Ages” (1200-800 BC), a period during which palaces were abandoned, writing disappeared, and the population dispersed into small rural communities. Nevertheless, this period of decline paradoxically paved the way for the emergence of a new form of social organization: the city-state or polis.

### The Archaic Period (800-500 BC)

The Archaic period marked the revival of Greek civilization with the emergence of the polis, a fundamental political structure defining a community of free and autonomous citizens. The Greek city was based on three elements: a social component (the body of citizens), a spatial component (a city and its territory, the chôra), and a sovereign state with regal powers.

The nerve center of the polis was the agora, a free public space where opinions were formed and collective decisions were made. As a space without hierarchy, the agora embodied the three founding principles of nascent democracy: equality of speech (isegoria), equality before the law (isonomia), and political equality.

This period also saw an explosion of Greek colonization, motivated by a lack of agricultural land, social unrest, and population growth. Between the 8th and 6th centuries BC, the Greeks founded hundreds of colonies around the Mediterranean and Black Seas, particularly in Magna Graecia (southern Italy) and Sicily. Among the major foundations were Naxos (735 BC), Syracuse (734 BC), Cumae (740 BC), Tarentum, Sybaris, and Crotone.

Politically, the Archaic period was marked by changing regimes: the initial monarchies gradually gave way to aristocratic oligarchies, then to tyrannies, before some cities adopted democratic forms or mixed constitutions. This political diversity would characterize the Greek world until its conquest by Rome.

## The Golden Age: the Classical period (500-323 BC)

### The Greco-Persian Wars and Greek affirmation

The Greco-Persian Wars (490-479 BC) pitted the Greek city-states against the Achaemenid Persian Empire, the largest empire of the time. The conflict began after the Greek city-states of Asia Minor revolted against Persian rule in 499 BC, supported by Athens and Eretria.

In 490 BC, during the First Persian War, the Athenians won a decisive victory at Marathon against the Persian army of Darius I, with 10,000 Athenian hoplites and 1,000 Plataeans repelling a Persian force that was vastly superior in numbers. This victory ensured the prestige of Athens and the nascent democracy.

Ten years later, Xerxes I launched a second massive invasion by land and sea. Despite the heroic sacrifice of Leonidas' 300 Spartans at Thermopylae and the sack of Athens, the Greeks won two decisive victories: the naval battle of Salamis (480 BC), orchestrated by Themistocles, in which the Athenian fleet destroyed the Persian fleet in the Strait of Salamis, and the land battle of Plataea (479 BC), which definitively drove the Persians out of Greece.

These victories against a vastly superior enemy forged a pan-Hellenic consciousness and established Athens as the dominant naval power in the Aegean Sea.

### The Age of Pericles and the Athenian Empire

After the Greco-Persian Wars, Athens took the lead in the Delian League, a defensive alliance created in 478 BC and bringing together nearly 250 Greek cities to protect themselves from possible Persian revenge. Each member city had to contribute ships or a financial tribute (phoros) initially deposited in the sanctuary of Delos, then transferred to Athens in 454 BC.

Gradually, this egalitarian alliance transformed into the Athenian empire. Athens, with the most powerful fleet, imposed its domination: cities that attempted to secede were violently suppressed, such as Naxos (468 BC), Thasos, and Samos (440 BC). The Athenian empire became an instrument of political, economic, and cultural domination.

The 5th century BC, known as the “century of Pericles,” marked the height of Athenian power. Elected strategist more than thirty times between 462 and 429 BC, Pericles strengthened democracy by introducing the misthos, a salary paid to citizens to enable them to participate in assemblies and courts, thus democratizing access to political office.
 
He also used the League's treasury to finance the reconstruction of the Acropolis, which had been destroyed by the Persians, giving rise to masterpieces such as the Parthenon, a symbol of Athenian power and democracy.

### Athenian democracy: how it worked and its limitations

Athenian democracy was a revolutionary political system based on the direct participation of citizens. The Ecclesia (citizens' assembly) met on the Pnyx hill and made major decisions by a show of hands. All citizens had the right and duty to participate. The Boule, a council of 500 members chosen by lot, prepared the sessions and handled day-to-day administration. Magistrates and judges were also chosen by lot for one-year terms, a principle that guaranteed political equality.

However, this democracy had significant limitations. Only male citizens born to Athenian parents after 451 BC enjoyed full political rights. Women, considered eternally minors, metics (foreign residents), and slaves were excluded from political life. Out of an estimated Athenian population of around 300,000 in the 5th century, only 30,000 to 40,000 citizens participated in decision-making, or about 10 to 15% of the total population.

Metics, although economically active and subject to the same military and tax obligations as citizens (plus a specific tax, the metoikion), had no political rights. Only exceptional services rendered to the city could, in rare cases, earn them citizenship.

### Sparta: the military oligarchy

In contrast to Athens, Sparta developed a rigorous oligarchic and militaristic system, organized according to the constitution attributed to the mythical lawgiver Lycurgus. The Spartan regime combined several elements: a diarchy (two hereditary kings with mainly religious and military functions), a gerousia (council of 28 elders elected for life and aged over 60), five annually elected ephors (the real holders of executive and judicial power), and a popular assembly (apella) with limited powers.

Spartan society was based on strict equality among citizens (homoioi, “the equals”), all of whom underwent rigorous military training (agôgè) and lived collectively. To maintain this equality, Lycurgus is said to have abolished gold and silver currency and redistributed land equitably. The economic system was based on the exploitation of the helots, a servile population who cultivated the land and allowed the Spartans to devote themselves entirely to military training.

### The Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC)

Tensions between Athens and Sparta, the two Greek superpowers, led to the Peloponnesian War, which ravaged the Greek world for nearly three decades. The conflict pitted the Delian League, dominated by Athens and its thalassocracy, against the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta and its land superiority.

The immediate trigger was the Megarian Decree issued by Athens, prohibiting Megara, an ally of Sparta, from accessing its market and port. The war unfolded in three phases: the Archidamian War (431-421 BC), marked by annual Spartan invasions of Attica and the typhus epidemic that killed Pericles and a third of the Athenian population; a precarious truce (Peace of Nicias, 421-415 BC); and the Decelean War (415-404 BC), a catastrophic period for Athens after the disaster of the Sicilian expedition, in which 200 of 300 triremes were destroyed.

The war ended in 404 BC with the surrender of Athens after the destruction of its fleet at Aegospotami by the Spartan strategist Lysander. Athens lost its empire, its fortifications, and its status as a great power. The conflict, masterfully recounted by the historian Thucydides, marked the end of the Greek golden age and permanently weakened the Greek cities, making them vulnerable to Macedonian ambitions.

### Macedonian hegemony and Alexander the Great

In the 4th century BC, the kingdom of Macedonia, long considered semi-barbaric by the southern Greeks, emerged as the dominant power. Philip II of Macedonia (359-336 BC) modernized his army, notably with the famous Macedonian phalanx, and gradually conquered Greece. After his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, he established the League of Corinth, placing the Greek cities under Macedonian hegemony while preparing a campaign against Persia.

His son Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) carried out this project on an unimaginable scale. Between 334 and 323 BC, he conquered the vast Achaemenid Persian Empire, from Anatolia to the Indus River, creating the largest empire ever formed at that time, covering approximately 5.2 million km². His major victories included Granicus (334 BC), Issus (333 BC) against Darius III, and Gaugamela (331 BC), which opened the gates to the Persian capitals of Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis.

Beyond military conquest, Alexander pursued a policy of cultural fusion between Greeks and Persians, symbolized by the wedding at Susa in 324 BC, where 10,000 of his companions married Asian women. He also founded numerous cities (at least 70 of which bore the name Alexandria), which became centers of Greek culture in the East. His premature death in Babylon in 323 BC, at the age of only 32, triggered a succession crisis that fragmented his empire.

## The Hellenistic period (323-31 BC)

### The Wars of the Diadochi and the Formation of Kingdoms

Alexander's death plunged his empire into forty years of fratricidal wars between his generals, the Diadochi (“successors”). These bloody conflicts culminated around 280 BC in the establishment of three great Hellenistic kingdoms:

**The Ptolemaic Kingdom (Egypt)**: founded by Ptolemy I, this prosperous kingdom controlled Egypt, Cyrenaica, and intermittently Coele-Syria. Its capital, Alexandria, became the main intellectual and commercial center of the Hellenistic world, home to the famous Library and Museum.

**The Seleucid Kingdom (Asia)**: established by Seleucus I, this vast empire stretched from Anatolia to Central Asia and Mesopotamia. Although the largest, it was also the least homogeneous and gradually fragmented.

**The Antigonid Kingdom (Macedonia)**: ruled by the descendants of Antigonus the One-Eyed, this kingdom dominated Macedonia and exerted varying degrees of influence over Greece itself.

These Hellenistic kingdoms were characterized by strong monarchical power inspired by the East, a sophisticated administration inherited from the Persians, and a cosmopolitan culture blending Greek and Eastern elements. Greek became the international language of administration, commerce, and culture, ensuring the linguistic unity of a politically fragmented world.

### Hellenistic culture and philosophy

The Hellenistic period developed an original culture, more individualistic and cosmopolitan than that of the classical period. Philosophically, three major schools marked this period:

**Epicureanism**, founded by Epicurus, proposed a materialistic philosophy inspired by Democritus' atomism. Epicureans sought ataraxia (freedom from disturbance) through the satisfaction of natural and necessary desires, a secluded life, and friendship. Since everything in the universe results from the random movement of atoms, the gods do not intervene in human affairs, thus freeing man from fear.

**Stoicism**, developed by Zeno of Kition and Chrysippus, taught that the universe is governed by an immanent logos (divine reason). The wise man must live in harmony with nature and accept with serenity what is beyond his control, cultivating the four cardinal virtues: wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. Stoicism enjoyed immense success in Rome with Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca.

**Skepticism**, represented notably by Pyrrho of Elis and Sextus Empiricus, advocated the suspension of judgment (epochē) on all metaphysical and theoretical questions as the only path to peace of mind.

These Hellenistic philosophies, less concerned with the construction of ideal states than Plato and Aristotle, focused on individual happiness in an unstable political context where the individual felt powerless. They exerted a major influence on later Roman and Christian thought.

## The Roman conquest of Greece

### The Macedonian Wars and Roman intervention

Roman expansion into the eastern Mediterranean began in the 3rd century BC, initially to combat Illyrian piracy and secure the Adriatic. Relations deteriorated when Philip V of Macedonia formed an alliance with Hannibal during the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), triggering the First Macedonian War (214-205 BC).

The **Second Macedonian War (200-197 BC)** marked Rome's decisive engagement in Greece. Philip V, alarming Pergamon and Rhodes with his expansionist ambitions, provoked Roman intervention. Proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus led a methodical campaign culminating in the Battle of Cynoscephalae (197 BC), where the Roman legions crushed the famous Macedonian phalanx for the first time. The peace treaty required Philip V to evacuate Greece and pay compensation.

In 196 BC, during the Isthmian Games in Corinth, Flamininus solemnly proclaimed “the freedom of the Greeks,” a brilliant diplomatic gesture presenting Rome as a liberator rather than a conqueror. However, this freedom proved illusory, as Rome regularly intervened in Greek affairs.

The **Third Macedonian War (171-168 BC)** pitted Rome against Perseus, son of Philip V, who was accused of preparing for a new war. After several years of indecisive fighting, the consul Paulus Aemilius inflicted a crushing defeat on Perseus at the Battle of Pydna on June 22, 168 BC. This victory brought an end to the Antigonid dynasty: Macedonia was divided into four semi-autonomous districts and then transformed into a Roman province in 148 BC.

### The destruction of Corinth and Roman rule

Persistent tensions between Rome and the Achaean League led to open conflict in 146 BC. After several unsuccessful diplomatic attempts, the consul Lucius Mummius Achaicus crushed the Achaean army at the Battle of Leucopetra near Corinth.

In retaliation and to set a terrifying example, the Romans completely destroyed Corinth, one of the richest cities in Greece. The city was razed to the ground, its population massacred or sold into slavery, and its territory declared *ager publicus* (Roman public land). This destruction symbolically marked the beginning of the period of Roman rule over Greece.

Greece was organized into the province of Achaea (separated from Macedonia in 27 BC), governed by a proconsul residing in Corinth (rebuilt by Julius Caesar in 44 BC). Nevertheless, Rome adopted a relatively respectful policy towards its Greek provinces, recognizing their cultural superiority. Certain cities such as Athens, Sparta, and Delphi retained a privileged status as “free cities,” exempt from taxes and garrisons.

## The Hellenization of Rome: “Reverse Cultural Imperialism”

### Successive waves of Greek influence

Greek influence on Rome came in two main waves. The first, beginning in the 6th century BC, resulted from contact with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (Magna Graecia) and the Etruscan heritage, which was itself deeply Hellenized. The second phase, beginning in the 2nd century BC, corresponded to the conquest of the Greek East and Rome's voluntary adoption of the culture of the vanquished.

This phenomenon of reverse acculturation sparked debate and resistance in Rome. Cato the Elder (234-149 BC) fiercely opposed Hellenization, which he perceived as a threat to traditional Roman values (*mos maiorum*). However, the irresistible appeal of Greek culture eventually prevailed in all areas.

### Greek-Latin bilingualism and education

The Roman aristocracy adopted Greek-Latin bilingualism, which became the hallmark of a refined education. Quintilian, in his *Institution Oratoria* (1st century AD), recommended that children be taught Greek first, then Latin, in order to master both languages “with equal care” (*utraque lingua cum aequali cura*). This bilingual education was followed by a study trip to Greece, particularly Athens or Rhodes, to perfect their training in rhetoric and philosophy.

Greek became much more than a foreign language in Rome: it was the language of intimacy, culture, and philosophy. Cicero, in his correspondence with Atticus, constantly switches between Latin and Greek with a spontaneity that reveals that Greek had become a true second mother tongue for the Roman elite. The emperors themselves, with a few exceptions such as Vespasian and Valens, were all bilingual.

This situation persisted until the 4th century AD, when the gradual separation between East and West led to a decline in bilingualism, although Greek retained its prestige in educated circles throughout the Middle Ages.

### Latin literature: creative emulation

Latin literature arose directly from Greek influence. Livius Andronicus, a Greek from Tarentum who was enslaved and then freed, translated Homer's *Odyssey* into Latin around 240 BC, thus creating the first Latin literary work and giving birth to Roman theater. This text served as a school textbook for several generations of Romans.

Latin literary genres imitated and then adapted Greek models: epic poetry (Virgil used the structure of the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey* in the *Aeneid*), lyric poetry, theater (comedy and tragedy), historiography, and philosophy. However, during the Augustan period, Rome established a new relationship with Greece: as Horace shows in his *Ars Poetica*, it was no longer a question of Hellenization of Latin poetry but of a true Romanization of Greek literature.

Cicero perfectly embodied this Greco-Roman synthesis: with his mastery of Greek rhetoric and philosophy, he adapted them to the Roman context, even creating Latin philosophical vocabulary that had not existed before.

### Art and architecture: imitation and innovation

Roman art underwent a profound Greek influence after the conquest of the East. Victorious generals brought back enormous quantities of Greek artworks as booty, stimulating a veritable “art market” among the Roman aristocracy. Cicero, in his correspondence with Atticus, expressed his desire to acquire statues, busts of Hermes, and other Greek objects to decorate his villas.

This vogue created such strong demand that workshops specialized in copying classical and Hellenistic Greek works. The Mahdia wreck, discovered in 1907 off the coast of Tunisia, contained an impressive cargo of Greek art objects destined for the Roman market.

Nevertheless, Roman art was not merely slavish imitation. The Romans developed their own innovations: realistic portraiture (versus Greek idealization), narrative historical reliefs (such as those on Trajan's Column), and above all new architectural types adapted to their needs: baths, amphitheaters, basilicas, triumphal arches, and aqueducts. The revolutionary use of concrete (*opus caementicium*) and the mastery of the arch, vault, and dome allowed for monumental constructions such as the Pantheon, unmatched in the Greek world.

Roman aqueducts perfectly illustrate this synthesis: inspired by Greek and Etruscan expertise, they were developed on an unprecedented scale and with unprecedented sophistication. Rome's aqueduct network, comprising eleven aqueducts at the end of the 1st century, could supply nearly one million cubic meters of water per day, or about 1,000 liters per inhabitant.

### Religion: syncretism and assimilation

Roman religion gradually incorporated Greek deities in a process of syncretism, assimilating the Greek gods to their Roman equivalents. Zeus became Jupiter, Hera became Juno, Athena became Minerva, Ares became Mars, Aphrodite became Venus, etc. This process of *interpretatio romana* enriched the Roman pantheon while maintaining continuity with ancestral traditions.

However, this assimilation was not complete. The Romans retained specifically Roman deities (Janus, Vesta) and sometimes modified the attributes of the Greek gods to adapt them to their context. Jupiter, for example, while identifying with Zeus, retained his specific role as protector of the Roman state and was honored in the Capitoline triad (Jupiter-Juno-Minerva) that dominated the Capitoline Hill.

Greek mystery cults, notably those of Dionysus (Bacchus), Demeter (Ceres), and later Eastern deities such as Isis and Mithras, also spread to Rome, contributing to the diversification of the Roman religious landscape.

### Philosophy: the Roman adoption of Greek schools

Greek philosophy had a decisive influence on Roman thought. Stoicism was particularly successful in Rome, attracting major figures such as Seneca (philosopher and advisor to Nero), Epictetus (a freed slave who became a philosopher) and the emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose *Meditations* represent the pinnacle of Stoic thought.

The poet Lucretius adapted Epicureanism into Latin in his *De Rerum Natura* (*On the Nature of Things*), expounding atomist physics and the search for peace of mind. Cicero, although skeptical of the Academy, played a crucial role in translating and adapting Greek philosophy for a Roman audience, creating the Latin philosophical vocabulary that would influence all subsequent Western thought.

This Roman appropriation of Greek philosophy was not passive: the Romans favored practical and ethical aspects rather than pure metaphysical speculation. Philosophy in Rome became primarily an art of living and a guide for political and personal action.

## Greek society: institutions and cultural life

### Social structure and citizenship

Classical Greek society was complexly stratified. At the top, male citizens formed a small elite that enjoyed full political rights. In 5th-century Athens, they are estimated to have represented about 10-15% of the total population.

Metics constituted a significant intermediate class, particularly in Athens, where they dominated trade and crafts. Although economically active and subject to military obligations, they remained excluded from political life and paid a specific tax (metoikion). Famous philosophers such as Aristotle were metics.

Slaves, who were private property with no legal rights, formed the basis of the Greek economy. Their numbers varied considerably depending on the city and the period, but they could represent a third or more of the total population. They worked in all sectors: agriculture, mining, crafts, and domestic service. Some skilled slaves could be freed, but without gaining citizenship.

Women, regardless of their birth, remained perpetually minors in legal terms, passing from the guardianship of their father to that of their husband. Excluded from political life and largely confined to the domestic sphere, they nevertheless played an important role in religious cults.

### Greek theater: a mirror of society

Theater was a central institution in Greek cultural life, deeply linked to religion and politics. Performances took place during the festivals of Dionysus, notably the Great Dionysia in Athens in the spring, transforming the entire city into a theatrical space.

Tragedy, a literary genre created in Athens in the 6th century BC, reached its peak in the 5th century with three great authors: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Aeschylus introduced the second actor, allowing for dialogue; Sophocles added a third actor and developed the psychology of the characters; Euripides explored moral and psychological dilemmas with disturbing realism. Tragedies, drawing their subjects from mythology, explored the universal themes of fate, justice, hubris (excess) and human suffering, provoking catharsis (emotional purification) through pity and fear.

**Comedy**, brilliantly represented by Aristophanes, served as social and political satire. Aristophanes did not hesitate to openly mock public figures (including Socrates in *The Clouds*), criticize Athenian politics during the Peloponnesian War (*Lysistrata*, *The Acharnians*, *Peace*) and ridiculing contemporary mores. This freedom of speech is a testament to the vitality of Athenian democracy.

Greek theater was not merely entertainment but a form of civic and moral education, questioning the fundamental values of the city and allowing the social body to reflect collectively on its institutions and beliefs.

### The Panhellenic Games: unity in diversity

The Panhellenic Games were special moments of unity for a politically fragmented Greek world. Four major games formed a regular cycle:

- **The Olympic Games**, celebrated every four years in Olympia in honor of Zeus, were the most prestigious. They included athletic events (running, wrestling, boxing, pankration, pentathlon), chariot races, and, later, artistic competitions.
- **The Pythian Games**, held every four years (and later every two years) in Delphi in honor of Apollo, gave prominence to musical and poetic competitions alongside sporting events. The winners received a laurel wreath, the symbol of Apollo.
- **The Isthmian Games**, celebrated every two years in Corinth in honor of Poseidon, combined sporting competitions and artistic performances.
- **The Nemean Games**, held every two years in Nemea in honor of Zeus or Heracles, depending on tradition, completed the cycle.

These games imposed a sacred truce (ekecheiria) during which hostilities had to cease, allowing athletes and spectators to travel safely. They reinforced the sense of belonging to a common cultural and religious community that transcended political divisions, helping to forge a pan-Hellenic identity.

### Religion and divination

Greek religion, polytheistic and anthropomorphic, permeated all aspects of life. Each city had its own patron deity (Athena in Athens, Hera in Argos, etc.) and organized festivals and processions in its honor.

Divination played a central role, allowing mortals to know the will of the gods. Oracles, notably that of Apollo at Delphi and that of Zeus at Dodona, attracted visitors from all over the Greek world. The Pythia of Delphi, priestess of Apollo, delivered her oracles in a trance, her enigmatic words then being interpreted by the priests. Cities and individuals consulted the oracle before making any important decisions (war, colonization, marriage, etc.).

At Dodona, a sanctuary located in Epirus and considered the oldest oracle in Greece, Zeus gave his answers through the rustling of the leaves of the sacred oak tree and the sound of bronze cauldrons. Divination practices also included observing the flight of birds (ornithomancy), examining the entrails of sacrificed animals (hieroscopy), and interpreting natural phenomena (lightning, earthquakes, etc.).

This omnipresent religiosity structured time (religious calendar) and space (Panhellenic sanctuaries) and legitimized political decisions, demonstrating the impossibility for the Greeks to separate the sacred from the profane.

## Conclusion: the Greco-Roman legacy

The history of relations between Greece and Rome is a unique case of cultural interaction in which the military victor became the cultural conquered. This apparent paradox actually reveals a complex dynamic of transfer, adaptation, and creative synthesis. Rome did not simply passively copy Greek culture: it transformed it, adapted it to its own needs, and spread it throughout the Mediterranean world and beyond.

Rome's military conquest of Greece (168-146 BC) certainly marked the end of Greek political independence, but paradoxically also the beginning of an unprecedented cultural expansion. Greek became the international language of the eastern Mediterranean, coexisting with Latin in a bilingual empire. The Roman elites, who were perfectly bilingual, ensured the transmission and preservation of the Greek heritage.

This fusion gave rise to the Greco-Roman civilization that forms the foundation of Western culture. In all fields—language and literature, philosophy, art and architecture, law and political organization, science and mathematics—the Greco-Roman heritage still structures our thinking and our institutions today. The educational system based on the study of classical humanities (Greek and Latin), democratic regimes inspired by the Athenian model, neoclassical architecture, and Western philosophy still in dialogue with Plato and Aristotle testify to the millennial vitality of this heritage.

The history of ancient Greece and its relations with Rome shows that cultural power can transcend and even reverse political domination, and that the greatest empires are those that know how to integrate and synthesize the contributions of multiple civilizations. Paul Valéry's words sum up this historical lesson admirably: “We civilizations now know that we are mortal”—but the Greco-Roman heritage proves that a civilization can survive its political death by continuing to shape the minds and culture of its successors.
